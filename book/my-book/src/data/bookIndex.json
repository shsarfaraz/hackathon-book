    "title": "ROS 2 Nodes",
    "content": "In ROS 2, a Node is an executable process that performs computations. Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of a ROS 2 system, acting as a modular unit for specific functionalities. Each node is designed to do 'one thing well,' promoting code reusability and system robustness. For example, in a robotic system, you might have separate nodes for reading sensor data (e.g., a LiDAR node), processing image data (e.g., an image processing node), controlling motors (e.g., a motor control node), and planning paths (e.g., a navigation node). Nodes communicate with each other using various ROS 2 communication mechanisms, primarily Topics, Services, and Actions."

    "title": "ROS 2 Topics",
    "content": "Topics are the primary mechanism for asynchronous, many-to-many, publish-subscribe communication in ROS 2. Nodes use topics to exchange data streams. A node that wants to share data publishes messages to a topic, and any node interested in that data subscribes to that topic to receive the messages. This communication model is asynchronous (publishers and subscribers don't need to be running at the same time), decoupled (publishers and subscribers are separate entities), and many-to-many (multiple publishers can send data to the same topic, and multiple subscribers can receive data from the same topic). Messages sent over topics are typed, ensuring data consistency and integrity."

    "chapter": "Module 1: ROS 2 Core Concepts",
    "title": "ROS 2 Services",
    "content": "Services in ROS 2 provide a request/response communication model, which is synchronous and designed for one-to-one interactions. Unlike topics, where data flows continuously, services are used when a node needs to trigger an action or retrieve information from another node and receive a direct response. This communication model is synchronous (the client node sends a request and blocks until it receives a response), one-to-one (a single client sends a request to a single service server), and request/response (the communication involves a request message from the client and a response message from the server). Services are defined by .srv files, which specify the structure of both the request and response messages."
